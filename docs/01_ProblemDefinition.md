### Problem Definition

Teams in knowledge-driven organizations regularly work with long internal documents such as reports, specifications, policies, and meeting transcripts.
Manually reading and extracting key information from these documents is time-consuming, error-prone, and inconsistent across individuals.

As a result, critical information is often missed, delayed, or interpreted differently by different stakeholders.
This leads to slower decision-making, duplicated effort, and increased coordination overhead.

An AI-powered document intelligence service can automatically summarize long documents and extract structured information in a consistent manner.
This enables teams to quickly understand document content and reliably pass standardized outputs into downstream systems and workflows.

The goal is to reduce manual effort, improve information consistency, and enable faster, more reliable operational decisions.
